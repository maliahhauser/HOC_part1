        <h1>Significance</h1>
        <p>Steve Jobs is one of the most well-known innovators of the 1970s microcomputer movement. He created and promoted the first highly successful mass-produced personal computer, the Apple II.<br>
            <br>Since its founding in Steve Jobs' garage in 1976, Apple has expanded into a multibillion-dollar corporation renowned for pushing the limits of technological innovation. Jobs spent a large portion of his time at Apple designing the "look and feel" of items; he made aesthetically pleasing goods and understood how to sell them to customers.<br>
            <br>In 1986, Jobs entered the animation industry by purchasing Pixar. Despite having its initial focus on hardware, Pixar went on to become a leader in computer-animated film, creating blockbuster hits like "Toy Story." His work with Pixar demonstrated how computer graphics may be used in entertainment.<br>
            <br>With the release of iTunes and the iPod, Jobs completely changed the digital music industry by redefining how consumers access and manage their music collections. The iPhone, introduced in 2007, was a revolutionary device that included a phone, music player, and internet browser. This marked the start of a new age in mobile computing and impacted the industry-wide design and operation of smartphones.<br>
            <br>Around 450 patents covering a wide range of technologies—from computers and portable devices to touch-based interfaces, speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards, and packaging—have been granted to Jobs.<br>
